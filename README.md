# Predicting-Student-Success
This was the final project for a graduate-level statistics course, applying factor analysis to data on data collected on students' socioeconomic circumsatances.
The results were unexciting; the methodology should be sound, factor analysis was simply a poor choice for the data.

I would suggest looking at "Presentation for Predicting Student Success from Socioeconomic Factors.pdf" for a summary of the project.
"Predicting Student Success from Socioeconomic Factors.pdf" is the resulting paper that goes into detail about theory to meet the assignment's requirements 
but are unlikely to be interesting outside of that context.
